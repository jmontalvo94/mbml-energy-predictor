# 42186 - Model-based Machine Learning - Great Energy Predictor III
This repository is intended for the final project of the course '42186 - Model-based Machine Learning' from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It contains all the data, scripts, literature, and final report.

# Code
All assignments are coded in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using Pyro for the probabilistic programming and JAX for the speed-ups advantages.

# Project
The task is based on the Kaggle competition ["Great Energy Predictor III"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction), which contains a dataset with hourly measurements of energy consumption on different types of buildings in different sites (or regions). The imlplemented algorithms were: vanilla linear regression, bayesian linear regression, hierarchical regression (applied to a bunch of households), and several Linear Dynamical Systems with lags 1, 2, 24, and 168.
